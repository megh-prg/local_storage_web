  *WHAT IS LOCAL STORAGE AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT?*


Local storage is a JavaScript property that allows web applications to store data in a user's browser,
even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted.
The data is stored as key-value pairs and doesn't expire, so it's available for future sessions.
Local storage is a reliable storage solution for simpler data needs, such as strings, numbers, and small key-value assignments.
